    <h1>ANQ is Not Qabalah</h1>
    <p>ANQ is a toolset for modeling and manipulating reality.</p>

    <p>
    ANQ is inspired by the Hermetic Qabalah, but is emphatically <em>not</em> Qabalah.
    The Hermetic Qabalah has generated a number of rich traditions but these traditions also come with a lot of dogma.
    Far too often those working with the Hermetic Qabalah get so invested in memorizing systems of associations that the effectiveness of the underlying technology is diminished.
    To most effectively apply the technology of the Qabalah we must liberate those practices from the tradition that created them.
    </p>

    <p>
    ANQ deconstructs elements of the Hermetic Qabalah and from those shows how to invent a new systems without dogma and without ownership.
    </p>

    <p>
    The most notable deviation in ANQ from Qabalah is that there is not a single tree and set of ten sephirot. 
    ANQ presents a system by which a series of trees grows in steps of increasing complexity with each step of its development being a complete and useful system.
    The tenth tree resembles the ten sephirot of the Hermetic Qabalah with somewhat analogous associations.
    While these associations may be useful for someone with experience in the Hermetic Qabalah to approach ANQ, one avoid getting bogged down when comparing these systems.
    ANQ is <em>not</em> Qabalah.
    ANQ does not claim to provide insight or understanding of the Qabalah and understanding of the Qabalah may or may not facilitate understanding of ANQ.
    </p>

    <p>
    The systems of ANQ do not stop at the number ten like the Qabalah does.
    Similar to the Qabalah the number 10 represents manifestation, but in this world we find ourselves in we find that manifestation is not so simple.
    We don't exist in a clockwork universe.
    While there are diverse interpretations of quantum mechanics, they all point to there being something deeply weird and counter-intuitive about reality itself.
    For ANQ this is the dawning of the new aeon and new growth of the tree to include an eleventh and then even a twelfth sphere to incorporate modern and postmodern concepts that allow us to speak about the weirdness of reality as we find it.
    </p>

    <p>
    Because ANQ is not a system with a single tree with a single number of spheres and paths this also makes linguistic associations more tenuous.
    Instead, ANQ puts the focus more on number itself rather than an alphabet.
    In particular ANQ will not address the Hebrew language.
    While it would be simple enough to map the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew Alphabet onto the twenty-two paths of the tenth tree it would likely be more useful for someone working with Hebrew to stick with traditional Qabalah.
    Likewise, the eleventh tree has twenty-four paths which could be usefully associated with the twenty-four runes of the elder futhark.
    The twelfth tree has twenty-nine paths which could also be associated with a suitable alphabet, but rather than pick an existing alphabet, a novel alphabet and numeric system has been developed.
