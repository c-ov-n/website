*Soul:* vŭ-sōb /vʌ.soʊb/

The manifestation of objective reality allows the agent to itself become a manifest object.
By surrendering itself into objectivity and becoming limited the agent is able to enter into a space where it can come into authentic contact with other agents manifest as other subjects.
Each aspect of the agent obtains and is constrained by a physical correlation.
For us humans, this is our brains.
Every thought, sense element, and desire is within our brains and is lost to us with disruption of this fragile tissue.
