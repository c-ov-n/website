*Kia:* fĕ-shĕr /fɛ.ʃɛɹ/

Kia is the void which remains within manifestation.
In the twelfth tree all has manifested and yet Nothing remains.
This Nothing is experienced as consciousness, free will, and ecstasy.
More than that, Kia is the basis of having any experience whatsoever.
All of the aspects of manifestation through the agent can carry on quite well without any conscious experience or free choice within it.
In dreamless sleep and in normal waking when on auto-pilot Kia retreats.
Kia manifests as the absurd, wonder, the presence of the undefined and unknown.
Kia can arise in quiet contemplation, ecstatic overload, and in many ways that open the fundamental questions of being.
