*Process:* hĕzh-ēsh /hɛʒ.iʃ/

That which asserts itself into being does not exhaust possibility.
Every aspect of being is incomplete, retaining its relation to void while constraining and permitting that which may follow.
Each emmanation leaves space for the next emmanation.
All connection is made possible by what is left undetermined
Reality is never fully manifest.

In the tree of hĕzh-ēsh we see the first budding of a sphere and the growth of the first path.
Paths are numbered by the order in which they appear, starting at zero.
The glyph of hĕzh-ēsh and its pronunciation is produced in the same manner as explaned above for nĕsh-hĭn.
