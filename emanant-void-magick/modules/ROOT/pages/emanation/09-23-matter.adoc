*Matter:* ĕ-pĕp /ɛ.pĕp/

Through desire the agent manifests the objectively real.
The external is truly manifest beyond whatever sense, thoughts, or desires the agent may hold regarding it, so completing the self-overcoming of the agent.
The objective binds the agent while also making possible the emergence of the next level of agency within objective reality.
The agent has surrendered its naive omnipotence in its embrace of a new greater level of being in which it only has marginal and indirect power in exchange for a greater state of being.
