*Desire:* ät-thĕl /ɑt.θɛl/

Having formed memory the agent now is able to experience the external as something to be sought after or avoided.
Want and fear and all the aspects of emotional attachment emerge.
Desire attaches the agent to the external and so opens a channel for the external to truly manifest.
It is attachment to the world that makes the world.
We regard this as a positive development, an overcoming of the limited solipsistic self through desire.
