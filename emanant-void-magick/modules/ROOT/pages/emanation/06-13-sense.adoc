*Sense:* jŏth-tŏi /d͡ʒɑθ.tɔɪ/

Agents may be blind actors, no more than a self-catalyzing reaction, or the agent may develop the capability of sensing and reacting to its environment.
Sense is the essential element of the encounter of that which is beyond the self.
It is the beginning of external self-organization that leads to external manifestation.
It is an echo of Process yielded through the incompleteness of the agent.
