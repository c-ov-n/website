== Flower of Emanation

This figure sumarizes the process of manifestation.

.Flower of Emanation
image::flower-of-emanation.svg[width=100%]

In the center of the flower is a point, representing [.inline]##image:sphere-glyphs/sphere-00-01.svg[]## Chaos.
Crossing the point is a line, representing [.inline]##image:sphere-glyphs/sphere-01-02.svg[]## Process.
This line also divides a triangle, representing [.inline]##image:sphere-glyphs/sphere-02-03.svg[]## Pattern.
These give the progression 0 → 1 → 2 → 3, the numbers of the first triad.
With [.inline]##image:sphere-glyphs/sphere-03-05.svg[]## Form we move from its sequence, 3,
to its prime, 5.
Then we jump to [.inline]##image:sphere-glyphs/sphere-05-11.svg[]## Agent with its sequence number, 5,
and its prime, 11, which brings us to the 11 pointed star.
From 11 we jump to the sequence number of [.inline]##image:sphere-glyphs/sphere-11-31.svg[]## Kia.
Its prime of 31 is represented in the 31 petals of the flower.
These petals are arranged following the Fibonacci sequence:
2 → 3 → 5 → 8 → 13.
The Fibbonacci sequence is known to occur in many natural systems including growth of flower petals,
making it particularly suited for reflecting the intricacy and delicacy of manifestation.
