Rules of a game shape the strategy but do not define the strategy.
Strategies are discovered by the players.
Three points define a plane.
Five points make the simplest star.

This is the essence of Form: the pattern of a system forms nodes, emergent properties.
There are things which simply appear within complex systems.

A system may be closed, static, such as the universe of number, or it may be dynamic and changing.
Forms in a dynamic system may be created and destroyed and they may influence the unfolding of the system itself to form self-perpetuating agents.

Each sphere exists within each other.
In the sphere of (4/7) Change this sphere appears as a unit of change.
In (8/19) Desire a form is a goal, an intent.
