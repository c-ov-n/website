= Fool's Journey

The Fool's Journey is the story of the trumps of the major arcana of the tarot.
The paths of the trees of void emanation follow and expand upon this tradition.

== History of Tarot

Tarot evolved as a card game in Italy in the 15th century.
Originally known as _trionfi_, “triumphs”, it built on earlier Egyptian card sets by adding what would come to be known as the “trump” cards and later “major arcana”.
The number of trumps varied in early decks before settling on twenty-two cards ranked in a hierarchy, though not all sets agreed on the cards or ordering.

In the mid 19th century the trumps of the tarot gained an important new meaning and relevance for occult philosophy.
In 1854-1856 Éliphas Lévi published _Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie_ [The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic]
in which he associates the twenty-two trumps of the major arcana to the twenty-two letters of Hebrew and so to the Hermetic Qabalah.
This is further developed in 1889 by Gérard Encausse, writing under the pseudonym “Papus”, in his _Le Tarot des Bohémiens_ [The Tarot of the Bohemians].
An exemplar of perennialist occult philosophy,
Lévi and Papus make bold speculative claims about ancient origins of the tarot in their works and lay the groundwork for further occult system building.

This syncretic association made the tarot central to Western occult philosophy.
It both added significant depth to the interpretation of the trumps as well as providing new names and rich symbolism to the paths of the Qabalistic tree of life.
Despite the fantastic claims to ancient wisdom lineages made by these influential authors,
those that followed would completely rework the correspondences into the common form we now find.

In the early 20th century another major development in tarot was the development of the Rider-Waite (aka Waite-Smith) tarot.
Published in 1909 with iconic art of Pamela Colman Smith, it was developed according to symbolism of the Order of the Golden Dawn,
taking inspiration from Gérard Encausse, Éliphas Lévi, and others.
This deck actually completely remapped the Qabalistic associations suggested by Gérard Encausse.
Whereas Encausse associated the first Hewbrew letter, א (aleph) with the trump number one,
the Order of the Golden Dawn associated with the fool, numbered either zero or unnumbered in earlier sets.
This throws off the associations of all subsequent cards by one letter.
They also went on to change the ordering of trumps VIII and XI, Justice and Strength,
to match astrological significance.

Most modern tarot decks follow the Rider-Waite ordering and symbolism,
most without reference to the Qabalah and other work of the Order of the Golden Dawn which produced it.
Other decks retain the original ordering of Justice and Strength, which brings us to the next major development.

Aleister Crowley, a one time member of the Order of the Golden Dawn, would go on to design his own highly influential tarot.
The _Thoth Tarot_ was developed by Aleister Crowley with artist Lady Frieda Harris and completed in 1943.
Crowley published a book, _The Book of Thoth_, detailing its associations and with the Qabalah and other occult philosophy.
Crowley returned Justice and Strength to their original order and renamed them “Adjustment” and “Lust”.
He also switched the Qabalistic attributions of VI Emperor and XVII Star.
He renamed World to “Universe” and completely replaced Judgement with a new card associated with this system of Thelema and named it “Aeon”.

A final interprative key was added by Eden Gray in the 1950s.
Gray introduced the Fool's Journey, an interpretation of the major arcana as a narrative journey of the individual through life.
From the Fool as the soul before incarnation through life experiences enduring trials and gaining wisdom through finally returning to the Fool.
This insight brings the major arcana into a thematic unity.

All this is to show that associations, interpretations, ordering, and even number of the trumps in the major arcana has changed over time.
In the present work we take inspiration from the work that has gone before while rejecting the perennialist and syncretic aspects of earlier work.
Instead of claiming authority based on a supposed ancient tradition,
we trust you to judge for yourself based only on whatever you may find useful,
and, instead of attempting to map and distort all traditions to fit one master system,
we provide a flexible framework that you may adapt to your particular use.

== Walking the Paths

The Fool's Journey begins at zero and moves by the paths through the influences of the spheres.
The journey is distinct from emanation yet inexorably interwoven with it.
While emanation shows formation of reality, the Fool's Journey plots a path for existing within it.

The key insight of the Fool's Journey is that the tree itself is a map of a journey.
Like a graph in mathematics, the tree is walked.
Starting from the firsh sphere we traverse each path only once using a simple method:
at each step, traverse the unwalked path with the lowest emanation number.

In addition to other correspondences of the tarot, walking the Fool's Journey gives directionality to each path.
Some are anterograde, moving forward from an earlier sphere to a later sphere.
Others are retrograde, moving backwards from later to earlier.
This provides insight to reading the cards in averse as this indicates movement along the path in the opposite direction.

Several trees are walkable in this manner.
The first three are walkable in a trivial manner.
The first interesting walkable tree occurs with the tree of Sense, jŏth-tŏi.
The next occurs with the tree of Desire, ät-thĕl.
The final is the tree of Kia, fĕ-shĕr.

We will look into the last in detail as it contains the paths of the others.

Having entered into desire through the Devel we now encounter desire in its immediacy.
It hits us like a lightning strike.
Pain is not an abstract desire to avoid; the hurt is real, immediate.
Likewise desire and want hits us and moves us in spite of ourselves, whether it be experienced as pleasure or pain.

In the ANQ sequence we start with the fool at zero, so even without the emergent number of seventeen there is a sense that this is the seventeenth path in the lunar cycle and associated with the beginning of the waning of the moon.

The tower is associated with the number sixteen in the Fool's Journey.
In binary sixteen, `10000`, is a mark of completion, echoing zero.
It the cycle of pronunciation it is the turning point backwards.

Tower is also seventeen, the breaking of the perfection of sixteen to produce the next prime.
Its position on the tree also echos the Fool, but where the fool is innocent and above consequence the Tower is entirely about consequence.

Regarding these numbers,
https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/C.html#ref246[Plutarch wrote in Isis and Osiris]:

[quote,Plutarch, "Isis and Osiris, 42"]
The Egyptians have a legend that the end of Osiris's life came on the seventeenth of the month,
on which day it is quite evident to the eye that the period of the full moon is over.
Because of this the Pythagoreans call this day "the Barrier," and utterly abominate this number.
For the number seventeen, coming in between the square sixteen and the oblong rectangle eighteen,
which, as it happens, are the only plane figures that have their perimeters equal their areas,
bars them off from each other and disjoins them,
and breaks up the ratio of eight to eight and an eighth by its division into unequal intervals.
