= Number

Number is a story of emanation of being from non-being.
Its sequence from zero towards infinity with each step deepening the complexity of relationships
parallels the narrative of emanation of being from Void.
The narrative of emanation is woven around the counting numbers, giving a system of arithmology.

A trouble with number is that too many of us learned numbers as a formative experience of social control of our mind,
authority telling us to memorize and repeat rather than explore and understand.
Many of us experience numbers at school as the first place where we are told that we are wrong.
Numbers and mathematics too often become sheets of tedious work covered in red marks exposing our mistakes.

To recover number as itself it is helpful to have symbols which allow us to experience it anew.
Dropping the decimal system is a useful tool for this.
The factor glyphs are built up of the relations of each number to its sequence and prime factorization.
They visually encode information while making them sufficiently alien to be experienced as they are,
fundamental units of the deepest mysteries.

There are two sets of glyphs used within this material: factor and sequence.
For both sets we just name and number zero to thirty-one.
The systems described or a place system could be used to represent larger numbers,
but this is unnecessary in the context of the present work.

== Factor Glyphs

The factor glyphs begin with zero and one, a circle and a vertical line.
These are special cases as these numbers do not take part in factorization.
Two is a straight horizontal line.
Three is a curve.
Four is the first factored number, made of two times two, two straight lines joined.
Five is a spiral.
Six is the curve of three joined to the straight line of two.
Seven and all subsequent primes are formed by taking the glyph of the previous number,
shifting the final line to a diagonal,
and making a cross mark.
When there are multiple such cross marks they are joined in an arc, primarily for aesthetics.

The relationships between the numbers are readily apparent because these glyphs are constructed procedurally from the factorization.
This aids in intuitive association.

== Sequence Glyphs

The sequence glyphs are used to order things which occur in a sequence but which are not necessarily comparable in a sense of magnitude.
This second set of symbols is particularly useful when numbering paths,
which will have one number given by its emanation order and a second number given by its sequence in the fool's journey.

The form of the sequence glyphs is formed first by the same initial forms as the factor glyphs.
Starting at five the pattern emerges of dot, line, arc indicating the base glyph plus one, two or three.
Twelve is formed as a merging of glyphs for eight and four.
Twenty is formed from sixteen and four.
Twenty-four is formed from sixteen and eight.
Twente-eight is formed from sixteen, eight, and four.

== Pronunciation

In addition to the glyph sets each number is also given a pronunciation.
Like the glyphs these pronunciations allow for a fresh encounter with the idea of number.
The pronunciations are based on the spoken sounds in English ordered systematically
by a number of rules to bring out the relationships between the numbers.
The rules themselves are not important other than that they build phonetic associations to help us intuitively identify relationships.

The pronuciations are paired in a cycle where the initial and final sounds
of each are paired. Zero and sixteen are their own opposite.
For the mathematically inclined,
you might note that this pairing follows a two's complement of five-digit binary representation of each number.
In normal binary notation this matches each number one to fifteen with its negative.

Consonant sounds are arranged in voiced and unvoiced pairs such as the sounds of ‚Äúd‚Äù and ‚Äút‚Äù.
These are then paired with primes such that the unvoiced consonant is the initial sound of the prime,
and the voiced consonant is is asigned as the initial sound of the preceding composite number.
The ordering of the vowels and remaining consonants is the result of aesthetic choice following much experimentation.

Pronunciation is given in both English pronunciation (enPR) and International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).
An exception is the dotted ‚Äú·πô‚Äù, which is used for the trilled ‚Äúr‚Äù such as in Spanish.
The modified enPR notation will be used in naming throughout this work.
Note that enPR uses italic ‚Äúùë°‚Ñé‚Äù for the voiced sound as in ‚Äúthey‚Äù while ‚Äúth‚Äù is unvoiced as in ‚Äúwith‚Äù.
